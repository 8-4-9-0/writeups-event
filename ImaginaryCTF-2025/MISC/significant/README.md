## significant (100pt / 710 solves)
> The signpost knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't, by subtracting where it is, from where it isn't, or where it isn't, from where it is, whichever is greater. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position where it was, is now the position that it isn't.

> Please find the coordinates (lat, long) of this signpost to the nearest 3 decimals, separated by a comma with no space. Ensure that you are rounding and not truncating before you make a ticket. Example flag: ictf{-12.345,6.789}
